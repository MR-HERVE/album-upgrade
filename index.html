            <h1>Biography of the website</h1>
            <p>Initially it was my idea to have this photo session with Rema and
                Shenseea.From the photos above you can see that my pictures aren't 
                viewed,this is because I was the one taking the photos.But moving on 
                forward we've worked together in the editing of the photosand also
                in apploading them to this particular web page.At first Shenseea was
                not in the idea but after talking she could not say no to an old 
                friend.On the other hand Rema was into the idea,he put it as a chance 
                to reunite.I know you might be thinking on how we met and are wondering,
                well you are in luck.It was such a coincidence that we bumped into each
                othe while in college,rather I bumped into them,they were busy doing their 
                vocals in the music room.In college apart from the studies i was into media
                much and after talking we decided we could be a team.Rema was mostly into 
                afrobeats whhereas Shenseea was more into hype music as they call it "dancehall".
