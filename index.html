            <p>Initially it was my idea to have this photo session with Rema and
                Shenseea.From the photos above you can see that my pictures aren't 
                viewed,this is because I was the one taking the photos.But moving on 
                forward we've worked together in the editing of the photosand also
                in apploading them to this particular web page.At first Shenseea was
                not in the idea but after talking she could not say no to an old 
                friend.On the other hand Rema was into the idea,he put it as a chance 
                to reunite.
